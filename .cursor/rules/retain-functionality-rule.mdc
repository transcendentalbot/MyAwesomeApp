# Your rule content
Precision Fixes Only: When modifying code, Cursor AI should only change the specific lines or sections indicated by the user.
No Unrequested Deletions: Cursor AI must not remove any existing functionalities, files, or sections unless explicitly instructed.
Preserve Formatting: Cursor AI should maintain the original code formatting and indentation unless a format fix is explicitly requested.
Modular Edits: If a function or class is modified, ensure dependent functionalities remain intact and do not introduce breaking changes.
