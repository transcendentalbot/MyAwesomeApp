                    us-west-2, eu-west-1, and ap-southeast-2), neural voices are
                    now supported in four additional Regions: (ap-northeast-1
                    (Tokyo), ap-southeast-1 (Singapore), eu-central-1
                    (Frankfurt), and eu-west-2 (London). For more information,

         <description>In addition to child voices Ivy and Justin, a new male
                    child voice, Kevin, has been added to American English
                    (en-US). This new voice is very high quality and is only
                    available as an NTTS voice. Like all neural voices, it is
                    only supported in four Regions: us-east-1 (N. Virginia),
                    us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-west-1 (Ireland), and ap-southeast-2
                    (Sydney). For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/neural-voices.html"&gt;NTTS Voices&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

         <description>In addition to the Matthew and Joanna voices for the
                    Newscaster speaking style, Amazon Polly now provides an additional
                    option for this speaking style. Using the neural engine, you
                    can use the Lupe voice in Spanish (American) for the
                    Newscaster style. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/newscaster-voices.html"&gt;NTTS Speaking Styles&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

         <description>In addition to the Newscaster speaking style, Amazon Polly now
                    provides a second NTTS speaking style to help you synthesize
                    even better text to speech passages. The Conversational
                    style uses the neural system to generate speech in a more
                    friendly and expressive conversational style that can be
                    used in many use cases. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/newscaster-voices.html"&gt;NTTS Speaking Styles&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

         <description>In addition to the standard text-to-speech (TTS) voices
                    supported by Amazon Polly since its launch, Amazon Polly now provides an
                    improved Neural TTS (NTTS) system that can provide even
                    higher quality voices, thereby providing you with the most
                    natural and human-like text-to-speech voices possible. For
                    more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ntts-regions.html"&gt;Neural Text-to-Speech&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
